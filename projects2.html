            <h4>Vecheck Client SMS view</h4>
            <p>I designed the SMS view for Vecheck, a digital vehicle inspection software that enables service centers to send detailed inspection reports directly to clients. This new SMS interface presents a clear, mobile-friendly summary of the vehicle’s inspection, including identified issues, recommended services, and tailored offers. Clients can quickly review all findings, select the services they want, and proceed through a streamlined checkout screen—all from within the SMS. The goal is to improve communication, increase service approvals, and deliver a seamless experience for the end customer.

            <h4>UX Design Case Study TerraClean App</h4>
            <p>This project is a research case study UX Design. It is about the development of a volunteering app where people can find different events and join or sign up for them in their community. The research is based from interviewing volunteers and it is built by sketching and using wireframes method. The interview allowed me to get big takeaways on what people actually want to have featured on the app.
